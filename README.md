## Assumptions & Trade-offs
- We can create a role-based authentication process.
- We can implement real-time notifications for all events.
- We can improve the user interface to work well on all platforms.
- We can display a pie chart for ticket categories and a line chart for tickets over time.
- We can make the entire system subscription-based.
